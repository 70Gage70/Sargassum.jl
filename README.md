# Sargassum.jl

`Sargassum.jl` is a package for the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language that bundles all of the following functionality in one convenient location. Together, this represents a fully featured Sargassum analysis toolkit.

- State of the art physics simulation of Sargassum clumps using Maxey-Riley models with nonlinear spring interactions and customizable biological effects.
- Download raw AFAI data and generate Sargassum distribution maps yourself, or use precomputed maps available starting 2017.
- Plot your data quickly; all major objects can be visualized with one line of code!
- A zero code interface that allows the core tools to be used in a zero-code environment with built-in documentation.

`Sargassum.jl` was developed by the [Nonlinear Dynamics Group](https://nonlinear.earth.miami.edu/index.html) at the University of Miami.
