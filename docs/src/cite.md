The `Sargassum.jl` Julia package, authored by Gage Bonner, was developed with the support of the National Science Foundation (NSF) grant OCE2148499 titled 'Collaborative Research: Unraveling Connectivity Constraints and Pathways of Sargassum and the Nature of Their Variability by Building on a Maxey-Riley Framework for Drift Modeling,' awarded to Maria J. Olascoaga (Principal Investigator), along with Francisco J. Beron-Vera and Nathan Putman (co-Principal Investigators).
