# Advanced Simulation: Biology

Here we described advanced usage of the simulation functionality, in particular how to go beyond the built-in biology options for [`RaftParameters`](@ref). Covered in this section are `AbstractLand` and `AbstractGrowthDeathModel`, i.e. for the purposes of this discussion we would refer to death by beaching as a biological effect.

!!! tip "For advanced Julia users"
    The biological functionality is implemented using [Callbacks from OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/features/callback_functions/).

```@setup adv-b
using Sargassum
using Unitful
using Dates
using CairoMakie
```

## Overview

Biological effects are implemented on top of physics effects in a modular fashion. After each step of the integration, a `condition` function is called on the current state. If this `condition` returns `true`, an `affect!` function is called that applies the desired logic. Hence, what is required of the user is to implement the appropriate structure and a `condition` function that checks whether to do something and an `affect!` function that does that thing. In Sargassum.jl, these functions are directly defined on the structure, e.g.

```julia
struct MyBiology <: AbstractGrowthDeathModel
    # fields
end

(b::MyBiology)(u, t, integrator)    # condition
(b::MyBiology)(integrator)          # affect!
```

Here, `u` is the solution vector as described in [`RaftParameters`](@ref), `t` is the current time and `integrator` comes from the [underlying differential equations solver](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/basics/integrator/). In brief, `integrator` contains all the information required to carry out the integration. The most relevant fields are:

- `integrator.u` and `integrator.t` for the solution and time at the current step.
- `integrator.uprev` and `integrator.tprev` for solution and time at the previous step.
- `integrator.sol` for the full state of the solution; this can be called like a function at an arbitrary time to interpolate the solution at that value, or previous solutions and times can be accessed via `integrator.sol.u` and `integrator.sol.t`.
- `integrator.p` for the current [`RaftParameters`](@ref).

In Sargassum.jl, the tools for handling the actual growth or death of clumps are already built-in via the [`grow!`](@ref) and [`kill!`](@ref) functions.

## The `grow!` and `kill!` Functions

The `grow!` and `kill!` functions handle the mechanics of creating a new clump at `location` or killing a clump with index `i` or a set of clumps with indices `[i1, i2, ...]`. The signatures are

```julia
grow!(integrator; location)
kill!(integrator, index_or_indices)
```

`kill!` is straightfoward, it kills the clump(s) with `index_or_indices`. The implication is that it is up to the user to determine the indices of clumps that are to be killed. One pattern for accomplishing this is to let `MyBiology` have fields of the `Vector` type named `growths` and `deaths` which are populated during the call to `condition`. Then, the `affect!` function simply calls `kill!(integrator, deaths)` to execute the logic.

The `grow!` function has an optional argument `location`, which can be a pre-defined flag, an integer, or a `[x, y]` vector. The default value is the flag `"parent"`.

The possible flags are:
- `"parent"`: A parent clump is chosen randomly among clumps that already exist, and the new clump is placed \
a distance `integrator.rp.springs.L` away and at a uniformly random angle from it.
- `"com"`: The same as `"parent"`, except the center location is at the center of mass of the raft.

If `location` is an `Integer` with value `i`, then the new clump will be grown with `i`th clump (by vector location) as its parent.

If `location` is a `Vector{<:Real}`, the new clump will be placed at those `[x, y]` coordinates. 

## Custom `AbstractLand`

We begin by describing how to build a custom [`AbstractLand`](@ref) object since the `affect!` logic is usually simpler than a [`AbstractGrowthDeathModel`](@ref). We will recreate the built in [`Land`](@ref) to see how it is done. Referring to our earlier example, what is required of us is of the form

```julia
struct MyLand <: AbstractLand
    # fields
end

(b::MyLand)(u, t, integrator)    # condition
(b::MyLand)(integrator)          # affect!
```

Before proceeding, we should make sure we decide on the logic. In this case, the `condition` should check each clump to see if it is on land. If any clumps are on land, it should return `true` to signal that the `affect!` should act. Inside `affect!` we should call `kill!(integrator, inds)` on those `inds` that identify beached clumps. To avoid calculating the land status of clumps twice, we could add a field to `MyLand` called `deaths` and populate it with clumps that have reached land. 

```@example adv-b
struct MyLand <: AbstractLand
    deaths::Vector{Int64}

    # constructor that populates `death` with an empty vector
    function MyLand()
        return new(Int64[])
    end
end
```

Examining [`LAND_ITP`](@ref) and referring to [interpolants](simulation-interpolants.md), we see that a clump with position `(x, y)` is on land if `field(LAND_ITP, :land)(x, y) == 1`. Therefore,

```@example adv-b
### condition
function (l::MyLand)(u, t, integrator)
    empty!(l.deaths)                        # reset deaths
    N = size(u, 2)                          # number of clumps
    living = (1:N)[integrator.p.living]     # indices of clumps that are actually alive (see `RaftParameters`)
    for i in living        
        if field(LAND_ITP, :land)(u[:,i]...) == 1
            push!(l.deaths, i)
        end
    end

    if length(l.deaths) > 0
        return true # there is at least one death to resolve
    else
        return false
    end
end

### affect!
function (l::MyLand)(integrator)
    # we already know the clumps to kill, so we only have to invoke `kill!`
    kill!(integrator, l.deaths)

    @info "Killed clumps $(l.deaths) after $(integrator.t - integrator.p.ics.tspan[1]) days." # just for testing
    return nothing
end
```

Let's try this out by simulating some clumps close to land.

```@example adv-b
tspan = (DateTime(2018, 4, 13), DateTime(2018, 5, 3)) .|> datetime2time
ics = InitialConditions(tspan, range(-86.0, -81.0, length = 5), range(16.0, 18.0, length = 5), to_xy = true)
n_clumps_max = size(ics.ics, 2)
clumps = ClumpParameters()
springs = BOMBSpring(1.0, Î”L(ics))
connections = ConnectionsNearest(n_clumps_max, 2)
gd_model = ImmortalModel()
land = MyLand() # this is us!

rp = RaftParameters(
    ics = ics,
    clumps = clumps,
    springs = springs,
    connections = connections,
    gd_model = gd_model,
    land = land,
    n_clumps_max = n_clumps_max
)

rtr = simulate(rp)

fig = Figure()
ax = Axis(fig[1, 1], limits = (-100, -80, 15, 25))
viz!(ax, rtr)
viz!(ax, rtr.trajectories[2], color = :red)
viz!(ax, rtr.trajectories[16], color = :red)
viz!(ax, rtr.trajectories[12], color = :red)
land!(ax)

fig
```

We see that three clumps (highlighted in red) get too close to land and are removed from the integration. Programmatically, we note that e.g. clump 2 died after circling around its initial location with small velocity for a few days.

```@example adv-b
rtr.trajectories[2]
```

We could, for example, define `CloseEnoughLand <: AbstractLand` that kills clumps whose positions have been within a certain distance of land for a prescribed time.

## Custom `AbstractGrowthDeathModel`

The process of building a custom biological model is identical to that of building an `AbstractLand`. As we saw previously, the general scaffolding is

```julia
struct MyBiology <: AbstractGrowthDeathModel
    # fields
end

(b::MyBiology)(u, t, integrator)    # condition
(b::MyBiology)(integrator)          # affect!
```

In principle, there's nothing preventing an `AbstractGrowthDeathModel` from using `LAND_ITP` to compute its effects, i.e. one could pass `land = NoLand()` to `RaftParameters` and have their `AbstractGrowthDeathModel` contain land effects in addition to other biology.

We will define a simple biological model to illustrate some possibilities, but appropriate application of `kill!` and `grow!` allows essentially arbitrary behavior. The logic for our example will be

- after 5 days, kill half (rounded down) of the most southerly clumps (do this once)
- after 10 days, grow a clump next to each living clump in the `"parent"` sense of `grow!` (do this once)

Of course, this model is not very realistic, but it will illustrate the main ideas. First, we define our `MyBiology` object. It is useful (although not required) to have `growths` and `deaths` fields to avoid a doubling of computational effort. We also need `Bool` flags to ensure that the proposed events only happen once. This also requires a `mutable` struct to update these flags.

```@example adv-b
mutable struct MyBiology <: AbstractGrowthDeathModel
    growths::Vector{Int64}
    deaths::Vector{Int64}
    five_days_event::Bool
    ten_days_event::Bool

    # constructor
    function MyBiology()
        return new(Int64[], Int64[], false, false)
    end
end
```

Next, we implement the logic.

```@example adv-b
### condition
function (bio::MyBiology)(u, t, integrator)
    empty!(bio.deaths)                      # reset deaths
    empty!(bio.growths)                     # reset deaths
    N = size(u, 2)                          # number of clumps
    living = (1:N)[integrator.p.living]     # indices of clumps that are actually alive (see `RaftParameters`)
    t0 = integrator.p.ics.tspan[1]          # initial time

    if t - t0 > 5 && !bio.five_days_event
        ys = u[2,:]                                                                                
        sp = intersect(sortperm(ys), living) # only kill clumps that are already alive                             
        to_kill = sp[1:floor(Int64, length(sp)/2)]
        append!(bio.deaths, to_kill)
        bio.five_days_event = true
    end

    if t - t0 > 10 && !bio.ten_days_event
        append!(bio.growths, living) # each clump is a parent
        bio.ten_days_event = true
    end

    if length(bio.deaths) > 0 || length(bio.growths) > 0
        return true # there is at least one growth or death to resolve
    else
        return false
    end
end

### affect!
function (bio::MyBiology)(integrator)
    for i in bio.growths
        grow!(integrator, location = i)
    end

    kill!(integrator, bio.deaths) # does nothing if `bio.deaths` is empty

    @info "Killed clumps $(bio.deaths) and grew clumps $(bio.growths) after $(integrator.t - integrator.p.ics.tspan[1]) days." # just for testing
    return nothing
end
```

Let's try this out with a simulation. It's important to remember that `n_clumps_max` needs to be set large enough to accommodate the possible growth. Since the number of clumps can at most double, we'll take `n_clumps_max` to be double the initial number of clumps.

```@example adv-b
tspan = (DateTime(2018, 4, 13), DateTime(2018, 5, 3)) .|> datetime2time
ics = InitialConditions(tspan, range(-55.0, -50.0, length = 8), range(5.0, 10.0, length = 8), to_xy = true)
n_clumps_max = 2*size(ics.ics, 2) # note the 2
clumps = ClumpParameters()
springs = BOMBSpring(3.0, Î”L(ics))
connections = ConnectionsNearest(n_clumps_max, 2)
gd_model = MyBiology() # this is us!
land = Land() 

rp = RaftParameters(
    ics = ics,
    clumps = clumps,
    springs = springs,
    connections = connections,
    gd_model = gd_model,
    land = land,
    n_clumps_max = n_clumps_max
)

rtr = simulate(rp)
viz(rtr, limits = (-65, -45, 5, 15))
```

We can further visualize the number of clumps as a function of time to see more clearly that our biological model had the intended effect.

```@example adv-b
with_theme(theme_latexfonts()) do # with_theme since don't want degrees N/S etc.
    fig = Figure()
    ax = Axis(fig[1, 1], xlabel = "Days since April 13, 2018", ylabel = "Number of living clumps")
    ts = rtr.com.t |> x -> x .- first(x)
    lines!(ax, ts, rtr.n_clumps, linewidth = 4, color = :black)
    fig
end
```

Note that the effects did not take place exactly at 5 and 10 days since they can only be triggered at the end of a step, i.e. in this case they are triggered at the first step such that the integration time is greater than 5 (and 10).
